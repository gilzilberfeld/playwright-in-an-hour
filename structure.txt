Intro
	What it is
		How we got here
			Selenium, cypress
		History (Puppeteer, browser control protocol)
		Full test framework
			Registration, Runner, reporter, asserts
		And it's growing
		Comes in all the flavors
			 JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#/.NET
	How it works
		Automate driver to browser.
			 Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit
				Cross browser	
					Mobile emulation (geo location, screen size)
		Finds and operates locators
		V Registration example d01
			Operations, expects
		Running
			Extension , CLI (how it looks where it fails)
			Debugging
			*** Demo
			Local own server running
	Locators
		Finding locators (xpath, role, etc.)
	Expects	
		List
	What's cool
		Default is headless
			Fast
		It waits - Auto wait
			v Registration error example d02
			Tests are concise, readable
			The problem with that
				Errors are about timeouts.
		Isolation
			Page / Browser context
				Each test runs in isolation
				v demo d03
			More stable.
				This does not say anything about the backend.
				Parallel run.
	With everything
		CodeGen tool.
			*** Example
			Good for
			Problems
				Not the locator I want
				Fragility
				Maintainability
		API support
			v d04
		Accessibility testing
			v d05
		Component testing?
			-> *** Prepare
	Grouping and fixtures
		Before each/all
		  Registration example	
		describe
			v d06 Prepare
		Fixture
		-> *** Prepare
	The verdict
		Need to write less than before
		TDD with Playwright
		Don't gen and leave
		Don't copy and paste.
